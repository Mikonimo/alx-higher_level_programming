###JavaScript WarmUp###
##JavaScript Background##
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:
-- Scripting(same as we did with Python)
-- Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepof this language, we will do some scripting.
AFter, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using JavaScript and Jquery.
